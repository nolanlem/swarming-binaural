# swarming-binaural
Jupyter notebooks for teaching about recreating spatial swarms using HRIR convolution and coupled oscillators dynamics.

This tutorial is formatted for spyder code blocks. 

Spatial HRIRs are convolved with cricket chirps to reproduce the impression of an acoustic swarm. 
A simple coupled oscillator model is used to synchronize the chirps over time to emulate stridulation.
